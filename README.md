# ableton live rack converter

this makes racks look like they were made with ableton live 10.0.3. most racks work fine - if they use macro knob 9-16 those won't show up, but the rack will work fine.

windows: just drag and drop the .adg onto the converter exe
macos: drag and drop doesn't work, just use the terminal (ie: `./ableton-rack-converter ../racks/incompatible-rack.adg`)

compressor/decompressor are used in the same way for if u want to manually edit/inspect the xml

not working:
* vsts
* you tell me (ðŸ˜‰)
